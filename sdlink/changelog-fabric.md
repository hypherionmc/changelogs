### 1.16.5 is end of life. If anyone wishes to maintain this version, please get in touch with me on Discord

#### If you are upgrading from a version below 2.2, this version includes some big config changes. Please double-check your config after upgrading!

#### For the next while, we will only be releasing bug fix updates. We are working on Version 3 of this mod, to redo everything properly and end the rain of terror of the buggy AF V2 releases.


**Bug Fixes**:

* Fixed "say" and "me" being replaced from all messages sent with "say" and "me"
* Fixed `@here` and `@everyone` being pingable from chat
