#### This file supports Forge, Fabric and Quilt with a SINGLE file. Future releases will no longer have separate uploads for each.

#### Fabric versions require the Fabric API

#### Quilt versions require the Quilt Standard Libraries


**Notes:**

This version has some changes to how tabs are identified. If you have an existing resource pack, please double-check the tab names (and lang keys) by using /mct showTabNames true.
